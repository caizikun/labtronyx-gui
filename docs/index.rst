Labtronyx GUI
=============

The Labtronyx project is a instrument control and automation framework. It
features a robust core for simplifying communication with laboratory instruments
and provides users with a powerful interface for controlling and automating
tests and experiments. Labtronyx is developed in Python to take advantage of the
powerful and vast collection of libraries, as well as to provide an easy to
learn environment in which to develop.

The goals of the Labtronyx project can be found on the `Labtronyx GitHub page <http://github.com/protonyx/labtronyx>`_ .
This user guide will provide instruction on the use of the Labtronyx Graphical User Interface (GUI).
