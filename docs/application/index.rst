Using the Labtronyx Application
===============================

The InstrumentControl project contains a Graphical User Interface for visually 
managing and controlling instruments on local and remote machines. 

* Opening the InstrumentControl Application
* Loading Drivers of Instruments
	* Before instruments can be controlled remotely, they must be able to communicate 
	  with the computer.  This is accomplished by loading the driver of the individual instrument,
	  and the process is fairly simple. When the InstrumentControl Application is open, your
	  screen should look like this:

	* When the new instrument is plugged in, it will show up in the list.  Right Click on
	  the new instrument and select "Load Driver" (See Picture Below).
